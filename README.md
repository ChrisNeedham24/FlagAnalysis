# FlagAnalysis
A project analysing the intricacies of the flags of countries, and determining if specific features of flags can be used to determine other features.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING
To execute the iPython file, simply open the file in Jupyter Notebook and select 'Cell' from the toolbar, and then 'Run All'.

# OTHER NOTES
The included 'flagData.csv' file is the file from which the data set is loaded from, and that is why it is included. It must NOT be deleted, otherwise the code will not run.
